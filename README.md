# Supplementary Code for: Spatio-Temporal Additive Regression Model Selection for Urban Water Demand

This repository provides code and simulated data for the models in the 2019 SERR paper "Spatio-Temporal Additive Regression Model Selection for Urban Water Demand." 

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. You can then change simulation settings or use the models on your own data. The main scripts for running the models are located in the [src](src/) directory.

### Prerequisites

You will need:
* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), with packages `mgcv`, `Rcpp`, `RcppArmadillo`, and `spikeSlabGAM` installed
* [RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) (for Windows; other systems may need other compilers, e.g. [here](http://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-os-x/))

### Installing

Once the prerequisites above have been installed, you simply need to copy the files in this repo to your local machine.
